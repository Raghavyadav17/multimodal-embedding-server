# Multimodal Embedding Server

This repository contains a FastAPI server that serves multimodal embeddings. The server processes text, image, audio, and video data to generate embeddings using HuggingFace models like MIT-B0 or ResNet-50.

## Features

- **Text Embedding**: Generate embeddings from text using pre-trained models.
- **Image Embedding**: Generate embeddings from images using Vision Transformers or CNN models.
- **Audio & Video Embedding**: Endpoints available for processing audio and video (currently under development).

## Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the server on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multimodal-embedding-server.git
cd multimodal-embedding-server
2. Install Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, use pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the following dependencies:

FastAPI: The web framework to build the API server.

Uvicorn: ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.

Torch: PyTorch, a framework for deep learning models.

Transformers: Hugging Faceâ€™s library for pre-trained models like MIT-B0 and ResNet-50.

Pillow: Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing.

NumPy: Fundamental package for scientific computing.

Requests: For making HTTP requests (e.g., for fetching external resources).

OpenCV: For video processing.

3. Run the API Server
After installing the dependencies, you can run the FastAPI server with Uvicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app:app --reload
This will start the server and you'll see output like:

bash
Copy
Edit
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['.']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Your API will now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

4. Test the API Server
Once the server is running, you can access the following endpoints:

Text Embedding Endpoint
URL: /embedding/text

Method: POST

Description: Accepts a JSON object with a text field and returns the embedding.

Request Format:

Example request with curl:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/embedding/text" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "This is a test sentence."}'
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "embedding": [[0.123, 0.456, 0.789, ...]]  # The embedding vector
}
Image Embedding Endpoint
URL: /embedding/image

Method: POST

Description: Accepts an image file and returns the image embedding.

Request Format:

Example request with curl:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/embedding/image" -F "image=@your_image.jpg"
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "embedding": [[0.123, 0.456, 0.789, ...]]  # The image embedding vector
}
Audio Embedding Endpoint (Under Development)
URL: /embedding/audio

Method: POST

Description: Accepts an audio file and returns the audio embedding (currently under development).

Request Format:

Example request with curl:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/embedding/audio" -F "audio=@your_audio.mp3"
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "message": "Audio embedding endpoint is under construction."
}
Video Embedding Endpoint (Under Development)
URL: /embedding/video

Method: POST

Description: Accepts a video file and returns the video embedding (currently under development).

Request Format:

Example request with curl:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/embedding/video" -F "video=@your_video.mp4"
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "message": "Video embedding endpoint is under construction."
}
Docker (Optional)
If you want to deploy the FastAPI application using Docker, you can build and run a Docker container for the app.

1. Build the Docker Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t multimodal-embedding-server .
2. Run the Docker Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 8000:8000 multimodal-embedding-server
This will run the server inside a Docker container and map the internal port 8000 to your host machine's port 8000.
